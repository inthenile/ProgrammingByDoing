###47th ASSIGNMENT
Three Card Monte
This is the original "ball and cups" game where you try to find out which cup has the ball under it. You may play with three cups and a ball, three cards (two jacks and an ace), or three doors and a car. Basically, randomly select a cup to hide the "ball". Let the player guess which cup hides the ball. The player wins if they guess correctly.

Here I tried to get the assignment as close to the original example as possible, while keeping the code as clean and well-written as I can.
